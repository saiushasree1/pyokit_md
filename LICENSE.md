The provided text is the **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1, dated February 1999**.

**Overall Purpose:**
The LGPL is a free software license that aims to guarantee the freedom to share and change software, particularly for software libraries. It is a more permissive version of the GNU General Public License (GPL), specifically designed to allow linking with non-free software, which the ordinary GPL generally restricts.

**Structure and Key Sections:**

1.  **Preamble:**
    *   Explains the philosophy behind the GNU General Public Licenses: to ensure software freedom (freedom of use, distribution with or without charge, access to source code, ability to modify).
    *   Highlights the core distinction of the LGPL: it applies to "specially designated software packagesâ€”typically libraries" and permits their use in non-free programs.
    *   Clarifies that "free software" refers to freedom, not price.
    *   Outlines the rights granted to users (copy, distribute, modify, receive source code) and the responsibilities of distributors (pass on these rights, provide source code, show license terms).
    *   Emphasizes the "no warranty" clause and the importance of indicating modifications to protect the original author's reputation.
    *   Addresses patent issues, requiring any patent license for the library to be consistent with the LGPL's full freedom of use.
    *   Compares LGPL to GPL, explaining why the "Lesser" license is used for certain libraries (e.g., to encourage wider adoption, allow use in non-free programs to benefit broader free software use).
    *   Distinguishes between "a work based on the library" (contains derived code) and "a work that uses the library" (must be combined to run).

2.  **Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification (Sections 0-16):**
    *   **Section 0: Definitions:** Defines "License," "you," "library," "Library," "work based on the Library," and "Source code." Clarifies that activities outside copying, distribution, and modification are not covered.
    *   **Section 1: Verbatim Copying:** Allows verbatim copying and distribution of the Library's complete source code, provided all notices (copyright, warranty disclaimer, license) are kept intact. Users can charge a fee for the physical transfer and offer warranty.
    *   **Section 2: Modification and Derivative Works:** Permits modification and distribution of "works based on the Library" (i.e., derived works) under Section 1 terms, with additional conditions:
        *   The modified work must be a software library.
        *   Modified files must carry prominent change notices.
        *   The entire modified work must be licensed at no charge under the LGPL.
        *   If the modified Library relies on application-supplied functions/data, they must be optional for the Library to remain functional.
        *   Clarifies that the license applies to the whole work based on the Library, not independent sections.
    *   **Section 3: Opting for GNU GPL:** Allows applying the ordinary GNU GPL (version 2 or later) instead of LGPL by altering the license notices. This change is irreversible for that copy.
    *   **Section 4: Object Code/Executable Distribution:** Permits distributing the Library in object code or executable form, but *only if accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code* under Sections 1 and 2 terms.
    *   **Section 5: "Work that uses the Library" (Linking):**
        *   Defines a "work that uses the Library" as a program designed to work with the Library by compilation or linking, but containing no derivative of the Library itself. Such a work, in isolation, is outside the LGPL's scope.
        *   However, linking such a work with the Library *creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library* and is therefore covered by the LGPL.
        *   Discusses cases where object code might be considered derivative even if source code isn't (e.g., using header files with more than simple definitions).
    *   **Section 6: Distribution of Combined Works (The Core LGPL Exception):** This is the key section allowing linking with proprietary software. It permits combining or linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library and distributing the resulting combined work under *terms of your choice*, with specific provisos:
        *   The terms must permit modification for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging.
        *   Prominent notice of Library use and LGPL coverage must be given.
        *   A copy of the LGPL must be supplied.
        *   One of the following must be done to allow the user to modify the Library and relink:
            *   Provide complete corresponding source code for the Library (including changes) and, if an executable, the source/object code for the "work that uses the Library."
            *   Use a suitable shared library mechanism that uses a copy of the Library already on the user's system and operates with a modified, interface-compatible version.
            *   Provide a written offer for the materials specified in (a).
            *   Offer equivalent access to copy materials from a designated place.
            *   Verify the user has already received the materials.
        *   Exempts certain OS components from being distributed with the executable.
    *   **Section 7: Side-by-Side Libraries:** Allows combining LGPL-covered library facilities with other non-LGPL library facilities, provided separate distribution of the LGPL portion is permitted and prominent notice is given.
    *   **Section 8: Termination:** Any unauthorized copying, modification, sublicensing, linking, or distribution voids the license and terminates rights. Rights of compliant recipients are not terminated.
    *   **Section 9: Acceptance:** Acceptance of the license is implied by modifying or distributing the Library.
    *   **Section 10: Automatic Recipient Licensing:** Each recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor; you cannot impose further restrictions.
    *   **Section 11: Conflicting Obligations:** If external conditions (e.g., patent judgments) contradict LGPL terms, you may not distribute the Library at all if you cannot simultaneously satisfy both obligations.
    *   **Section 12: Geographical Limitations:** Original copyright holder can add geographical distribution limitations for patent/copyrighted interface reasons.
    *   **Section 13: New Versions:** Free Software Foundation may publish new versions; users can choose the specified version or any later version if the Library permits "any later version," or any published version if not specified.
    *   **Section 14: Incompatible Free Programs:** For incorporating parts of the Library into other free programs with incompatible conditions, users should seek permission from the author/Free Software Foundation.

3.  **NO WARRANTY (Sections 15-16):**
    *   **Section 15:** Explicitly states **NO WARRANTY** for the Library, as it is licensed free of charge. The Library is provided "AS IS" without express or implied warranties (e.g., MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE). The user bears the entire risk of quality and performance.
    *   **Section 16:** Disclaims liability for damages (general, special, incidental, consequential) arising from the use or inability to use the Library, even if advised of such damages.

4.  **How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries:**
    *   Provides guidance for developers who want to license their new libraries under the LGPL 2.1, including boilerplate notices to attach to source files.

**Important Details:**

*   **Permissiveness:** The LGPL is a **copyleft** license but is less restrictive than the ordinary GPL. Its main "lesser" aspect is the **linking exception** in Section 6, which allows proprietary (non-free) software to link with and use LGPL-covered libraries without requiring the entire combined work to be licensed under the LGPL.
*   **Source Code Availability:** A core tenet is that users of the software (including those who receive a program linked with an LGPL library) must always have the means to obtain, modify, and relink the LGPL-covered library itself.
*   **"Work Based on" vs. "Work that Uses":** This distinction is crucial. "Works based on" the Library (derivatives) are fully subject to the LGPL. "Works that use" the Library (e.g., an application that links to it) are not *in themselves* covered, but the *combined executable* is, and specific conditions (Section 6) apply to its distribution.
*   **No Warranty and Limited Liability:** The license strongly disclaims any warranty and limits liability, which is standard for free software licenses.
*   **Implications for Developers:** If you use an LGPL-licensed library in your software, you generally don't have to release your *entire* application under the LGPL, but you *must* comply with the terms for the distribution of the combined work (especially Section 6), ensuring users can modify and relink the library part.
