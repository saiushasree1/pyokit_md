This `Makefile` provides a set of common commands for managing the "Pyokit" software package, covering installation, documentation, testing, cleanup, and release management.

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Installation/Uninstallation:** Targets `install` and `uninstall` handle the deployment and removal of the Pyokit package using `pip` and `setup.py`.
*   **Documentation:** The `docs` target builds HTML documentation using Sphinx, and `doctest` runs Sphinx doctests.
*   **Unit Testing:** The `test` target executes the Python unit tests located at `src/test.py`.
*   **Housekeeping:** The `clean` target removes compiled Python bytecode files (`.pyc`).
*   **Version and Release Management:** A comprehensive set of targets (`releasePatch`, `releaseMinor`, `releaseMajor`) leverage `bumpversion` to automate version bumping, commit changes, and create Git tags. Targets `publishPyPITest` and `publishPyPI` are used to upload the package to PyPI test and production environments, respectively, via `setup.py`.

**Structure and Important Details:**

*   The Makefile is well-organized with clear section headers for different functionalities (Installation, Documentation, Unit Tests, Housekeeping, Version and Release Management).
*   It includes a detailed GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) header, indicating the software's open-source nature and licensing terms.
*   The `install` target first removes the `dist` directory, then creates a source distribution using `python setup.py sdist`, and finally installs it using `pip install`. The wildcard `?.?.?.` is used for the version number in the tarball, making it robust to version changes.
*   The `docs` target cleans the Sphinx build, builds HTML, and then reorganizes the output, moving files from `Docs/html` directly into `Docs` and removing the redundant `html` directory.
*   Several targets, particularly those related to documentation and release management, are marked with `.PHONY`, indicating that they are not actual files and should always be re-executed when called.
*   Release management targets (`releasePatch`, `releaseMinor`, `releaseMajor`) use `bumpversion` with specific options to commit the version bump and create a Git tag in the format `pyokit_{new_version}`.
*   Publishing targets use `python setup.py sdist upload` with different repository flags (`-r pypitest` or `-r pypi`) to distinguish between the test and production PyPI instances.
