The `README.md` file introduces **Pyokit**, a Python library designed to simplify the processing and analysis of high-throughput biological datasets.

**Key features and structure:**

*   **Purpose:** Pyokit provides a collection of tools for bioinformatics tasks within a Python environment.
*   **Dependencies:** It optionally depends on `rpy2` for some functionalities; Pyokit can be installed without it, but certain features will be unavailable.
*   **Installation:**
    *   **From PyPI (recommended):** Users can easily install Pyokit using `pip` (`pip install pyokit`). Instructions for installing `pip` itself are also provided.
    *   **From Source:** For the latest version, users can clone the GitHub repository, build the distribution package (`python setup.py sdist`), and then install it using `pip` (`pip install --no-index dist/pyokit-a.b.c.tar.gz`).
*   **Usage:** A link to the Pyokit manual (`http://pjuren.github.io/pyokit`) is provided for detailed usage instructions.
*   **Support:** Contact information for the author (Philip J. Uren) is given, along with guidelines for reporting bugs, emphasizing the importance of checking for updates, verifying input, and providing minimal reproducible examples.
*   **License:** Pyokit is distributed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or any later version**, allowing for redistribution and modification with certain conditions. It explicitly states a lack of warranty.

**Important Details for the Reader:**

*   **`rpy2` dependency:** Be aware that some Pyokit functionalities will be missing if `rpy2` is not installed.
*   **`sudo` for global installs:** When installing via `pip` globally, `sudo` might be required.
*   **Python path:** Users should ensure `python` points to their desired Python interpreter, especially in environments without admin access.
*   **Bug reporting:** The `README` provides clear instructions for effective bug reporting, which is helpful for both the user and the maintainer.
*   **Licensing:** Users should understand the LGPL license terms, particularly regarding redistribution, modification, and the disclaimer of warranty.
