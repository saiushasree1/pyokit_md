Defines a base model for SQLAlchemy database interactions, providing common attributes and methods.  Simplifies model creation and management by offering a consistent structure. Includes automatic timestamping for creation and updates, soft delete functionality, and utility methods for dictionary conversion and common database operations.  Facilitates easier querying and data manipulation within a Flask application.  The `BaseModel` class serves as a foundational building block for all database models in the application.

**Details**
The `BaseModel` class is the core component, inheriting from `db.Model`. It defines several standard columns: `id` (primary key), `created_at` (timestamp for creation), `updated_at` (timestamp for last update), and `deleted_at` (timestamp for soft deletion, allowing records to be marked as deleted without actual removal). The `__init__` method automatically sets `created_at` and `updated_at` upon object instantiation. The `save` method handles adding the instance to the database session and committing the changes. The `update` method updates the instance's attributes from a dictionary and sets the `updated_at` timestamp before committing. The `delete` method performs a soft delete by setting the `deleted_at` timestamp. The `hard_delete` method permanently removes the record from the database. The `to_dict` method converts the model instance into a dictionary, excluding specified fields like `deleted_at`. The `get_all` class method retrieves all non-deleted records of the model. The `get_by_id` class method fetches a specific record by its ID, ensuring it's not deleted. The `first` class method retrieves the first matching record based on provided filter criteria, excluding deleted records. The `filter_by` class method allows querying based on arbitrary keyword arguments, also filtering out deleted records. This design promotes code reusability and consistency across database models.
