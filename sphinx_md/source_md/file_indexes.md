This reStructuredText (RST) snippet, located in `file_indexes.rst`, defines a section titled "File indexes".

**Functionality:**

*   It declares a reStructuredText section with the title "File indexes".
*   It assigns a reStructuredText reference label `_fileIndexesSection:` to this section, allowing other parts of the documentation to link to it.
*   The content of the section currently contains only the placeholder text "under construction", indicating that the documentation for this section is not yet complete.

**Structure:**

The snippet follows standard reStructuredText heading syntax for a level 1 heading (underlined with `====`).

**Important Details:**

*   The `_fileIndexesSection:` is a Sphinx/reStructuredText cross-referencing target.
*   The "under construction" note is a clear indicator of incomplete documentation.
