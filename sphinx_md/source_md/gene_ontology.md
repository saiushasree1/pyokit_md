The provided code snippet from `gene_ontology.rst` describes how to process Gene Ontology (GO) data, specifically focusing on the input format produced by DAVID.

**Overview:**
The core functionality demonstrated is to load and consolidate GO enrichment analysis results from multiple DAVID output files. It then filters these results, keeping only GO terms that are statistically significant (p-value below a specified threshold) in at least one of the input files. Finally, it outputs the consolidated, filtered data, including the GO term name, p-value, category, and the originating filename.

**Structure and Workflow:**

1.  **Imports:** It imports `os` and `sys` (though `os` isn't directly used in the example, it's typically present for file operations) and `david_results_iterator` from `pyokit.io.david`.
2.  **Configuration:** A `PVAL_THRESHOLD` is set to `0.01` for significance filtering.
3.  **File Input:** It expects filenames as command-line arguments (`sys.argv[1:]`).
4.  **Data Loading and Consolidation:**
    *   It iterates through each input filename.
    *   For each file, it uses `david_results_iterator(fn)` to parse the DAVID results one by one.
    *   Results are stored in a nested dictionary `by_trm`. The outer key is the GO term name (`r.name`), and the inner dictionary uses the filename (`fn`) as a key, storing the full result object (`r`) for that term from that specific file. This structure allows quick access to a GO term's results across different files.
5.  **Filtering:**
    *   After loading all data, `by_trm` is filtered using a dictionary comprehension.
    *   A GO term is retained in `by_trm` *only if* the minimum p-value for that term across all loaded files is less than `PVAL_THRESHOLD`. This ensures that only terms with at least one significant finding are kept.
6.  **Output:**
    *   The filtered `by_trm` dictionary is iterated.
    *   For each GO term and each file it appeared in (within the filtered set), the term name, p-value, category, and original filename are printed, separated by tabs.

**Important Details:**

*   **Input Format:** The code explicitly states that it currently *only* supports the DAVID output format.
*   **`pyokit.io.david.david_results_iterator`:** This is a crucial function mentioned as an "autofunction" at the end, implying that its detailed documentation (likely including parameters and return types) would be generated and available elsewhere within the `pyokit` documentation. It's an iterator, meaning it processes file contents line by line, which is memory-efficient for large files.
*   **Significance Filtering Logic:** The `min([r.pvalue for fn in by_term[term]]) < PVAL_THRESHOLD` filtering ensures that a GO term is kept if it shows significance in *any* of the analyzed samples, not necessarily all of them.
*   **Data Structure (`by_trm`):** Understanding the `by_trm` dictionary's structure (`{term_name: {filename: result_object}}`) is key to following the data consolidation and filtering logic.
*   **Example Context:** The snippet is presented as a Python interactive session (`>>>`), demonstrating a practical use case rather than a standalone script.
