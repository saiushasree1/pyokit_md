This reStructuredText (RST) snippet, part of `genomicIntervals.rst`, defines a section titled "Genomic Intervals". It uses the `toctree` directive to include other RST documents, `bed.rst` and `genomicIntervals_manip.rst`, as sub-sections or related topics. The `maxdepth` of 4 indicates that the table of contents generated from these included files can go up to four levels deep. This structure suggests that "Genomic Intervals" is a high-level topic that branches into more specific areas like BED file format and manipulation of genomic intervals.
