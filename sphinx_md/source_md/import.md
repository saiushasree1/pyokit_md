This reStructuredText snippet, likely from a documentation file (`import.rst`), explains how to import modules from the `pyokit` Python library.

**Overview:**
The `pyokit` library is organized into five main sub-modules: `datastruct`, `mapping`, `sequencing`, `testing`, and `util`. The snippet provides a clear example of how to import a specific class (`IntervalTree`) from a nested module structure (`datastruct.intervalTree`) within the `pyokit` library.

**Structure and Details:**
*   It explicitly states the five top-level sub-modules of `pyokit`.
*   It demonstrates the import syntax using a Python interactive prompt example (`>>>`).
*   The example `from pyokit.datastruct.intervalTree import IntervalTree` shows a common way to import a specific class, making it directly accessible by its name (`IntervalTree`) in the current scope.
*   This structure suggests that `pyokit` is a well-organized library, categorizing its functionalities into logical sub-modules.
