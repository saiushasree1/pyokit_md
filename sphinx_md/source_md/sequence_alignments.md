The provided code snippet is a documentation file (`.rst`) for the `pyokit` library, specifically detailing its capabilities for sequence alignments.

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Pairwise Alignments:** The primary focus is on pairwise sequence alignments, represented by the `pyokit.datastruct.multipleAlignment.PairwiseAlignment` class. This class stores the sequence data of two sequences and associated metadata.
*   **Metadata:** The `PairwiseAlignment` class utilizes a dictionary for metadata, where certain predefined keys have special meanings, particularly for formatting and displaying alignments. These keys include:
    *   **Sequence Names and Coordinates:** Keys for the names and start/end coordinates of both sequences (`S1_NAME_KEY`, `S2_NAME_KEY`, `S1_START_KEY`, etc.), including options for negative strand coordinates.
    *   **Alignment Statistics:** Keys for the alignment score (`ALIG_SCORE_KEY`), general annotations (`ANNOTATION_KEY`), and indel percentages for each sequence (`PCENT_S1_INDELS_KEY`, `PCENT_S2_INDELS_KEY`).
    *   **RepeatMasker Specifics:** Keys specifically for alignments generated by RepeatMasker (`UNKNOWN_RM_HEADER_FIELD_KEY`, `RM_ID_KEY`).
    *   **All Known Keys:** A `KNOWN_KEYS` set enumerating all recognized metadata keys.
*   **Reading Pairwise Alignments:** Currently, `pyokit` provides an iterator specifically for reading RepeatMasker alignment files: `pyokit.io.alignmentIterators.repeat_masker_alignment_iterator`. A helper function, `_rm_parse_header_line`, is also documented for parsing the header of RepeatMasker files.

**Structure and Important Details:**

*   **reStructuredText Format:** The document is written in reStructuredText (`.rst`), indicated by the use of directives like `.. autoclass::`, `.. autodata::`, and `.. autofunction::` for automatically pulling documentation from Python code, and `.. doctest::` for executable examples.
*   **Limited Scope:** The document explicitly states that `pyokit` currently supports *only* pairwise alignments, with multiple sequence alignment support planned for the future.
*   **Metadata Importance:** The metadata associated with `PairwiseAlignment` objects is crucial for various functionalities, especially for generating formatted string representations of the alignments. While not all keys are strictly required, some may be necessary for specific output formats.
*   **RepeatMasker Focus:** The current implementation for reading alignments heavily emphasizes RepeatMasker format, providing a dedicated iterator and header parsing function for this specific format.
*   **Example Usage:** A `doctest` example demonstrates how to use `repeat_masker_alignment_iterator` to parse a sample RepeatMasker-like input string and count the resulting `PairwiseAlignment` objects. This example clearly illustrates the expected input format for the iterator.

In essence, this document serves as a guide for working with pairwise sequence alignments in `pyokit`, highlighting the `PairwiseAlignment` class, its significant metadata fields, and the current capabilities for reading RepeatMasker formatted alignment files.
