The Python code defines a base exception class `PyokitError` for the Pyokit library. This class inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class.

**Functionality:**

*   **`PyokitError(Exception)`:** This is the core class designed to be the parent for all custom exceptions within the Pyokit framework.
*   **`__init__(self, msg)`:** The constructor takes a `msg` argument, which is expected to be a string describing the error. This message is stored in the instance variable `self.value`.
*   **`__str__(self)`:** This method provides a string representation of the exception. It returns the `repr()` of the stored `value`, which means it will display the message string in a developer-friendly format (e.g., `'Error message here'`).

**Structure:**

The code is very simple, consisting of a single class definition with a constructor and a string representation method.

**Important Details:**

*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of `PyokitError` is to provide a common base for handling errors specific to the Pyokit library, allowing for more granular exception catching and handling.
*   **Inheritance:** Any specific Pyokit exceptions would typically inherit from `PyokitError` (e.g., `class MySpecificPyokitError(PyokitError):`).
*   **License:** The file includes a comprehensive GNU General Public License v3 (or later) header, indicating that the software is free and open-source.
