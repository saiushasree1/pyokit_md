The provided Python code snippet, from the file `geneOntology.py`, defines data structures for handling Gene Ontology (GO) data.

**Overview:**

The code establishes two classes:
1.  **`GeneOntologyTerm`**: Represents a basic Gene Ontology term, storing its name, an optional identifier, and an optional category.
2.  **`GeneOntologyEnrichmentResult`**: Extends `GeneOntologyTerm` to specifically represent the result of a GO enrichment analysis for a single term, adding a `pvalue` attribute.

**Structure and Functionality:**

*   **`GeneOntologyTerm` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** To encapsulate the fundamental information about a GO term.
    *   **`__init__(self, name, identified=None, catagory=None)`:** The constructor initializes `self.name` and `self.catagory`. Note that `identified` (likely a typo for `identifier`) is accepted as a parameter but not stored as an instance attribute within this class. This is an important detail to note.
    *   **Attributes:**
        *   `name`: The name of the GO term (e.g., "intracellular transport").
        *   `catagory`: The database or category the term belongs to (e.g., "GOTERM_BP_FAT").
        *   `identifier`: Although passed to the constructor, it's *not* stored as an attribute in this class.

*   **`GeneOntologyEnrichmentResult` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** To store a GO term along with its associated p-value from an enrichment calculation.
    *   **Inheritance:** It inherits from `GeneOntologyTerm`, meaning it automatically gains the `name` and `catagory` attributes (though `identifier` handling is still nuanced due to the parent class's implementation).
    *   **`__init__(self, name, pvalue, identifier=None, catagory=None)`:**
        *   It calls the parent class's constructor (`super().__init__(name, identifier, catagory)`) to initialize the inherited attributes.
        *   It then initializes its own specific attribute: `self.pvalue`.
    *   **Attributes:**
        *   `name` (inherited)
        *   `catagory` (inherited)
        *   `pvalue`: The significance p-value of the enrichment for this term.
        *   `identifier`: Passed to the parent constructor, but as noted, the parent `GeneOntologyTerm` doesn't store it internally.

**Important Details/Caveats:**

*   **Typo in `GeneOntologyTerm` constructor:** The parameter `identified` in `GeneOntologyTerm.__init__` is likely a typo and should be `identifier` for consistency with the docstring and common terminology. More critically, even if it were `identifier`, this parameter is *not* stored as an instance attribute within the `GeneOntologyTerm` class itself. This means that while `identifier` can be passed to the constructor of `GeneOntologyEnrichmentResult` and subsequently to `GeneOntologyTerm`, the `GeneOntologyTerm` object itself won't store it. If `identifier` is a crucial piece of information for a base GO term, it needs to be explicitly assigned (e.g., `self.identifier = identified`) within the `GeneOntologyTerm`'s `__init__` method.
*   **Copyright and Licensing:** The file includes a comprehensive GNU General Public License (GPLv3 or later) header, indicating that the code is free software.
*   **Documentation:** Both classes and their constructors have clear docstrings, explaining their purpose and parameters.
