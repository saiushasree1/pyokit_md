The `uiError.py` file defines a custom exception class, `PyokitUIError`, which inherits from `PyokitError` (presumably from the `pyokit.common` module). This class is designed to handle generic user interface errors within the Pyokit framework.

**Key Functionality:**

*   **`PyokitUIError(PyokitError)`:** This is the core exception class.
    *   **`__init__(self, msg)`:** The constructor takes a `msg` argument (presumably a string describing the error) and stores it in the `self.value` attribute.
    *   **`__str__(self)`:** This method provides a string representation of the error, returning the `repr()` of the `self.value`. This means the string output will show the "raw" representation of the error message, including quotes if `self.value` is a string.

**Structure:**

The file is straightforward, defining a single class `PyokitUIError` that extends an existing base exception.

**Important Details:**

*   **Licensing:** The file is released under the GNU General Public License v3 or later, making it free software.
*   **Purpose:** It aims to provide a standardized way to signal and handle UI-related errors within the Pyokit ecosystem.
*   **Error Message Representation:** The `__str__` method uses `repr(self.value)` for the string representation, which might be a notable detail if a more user-friendly or formatted error message is desired directly from `str()`. This typically shows the "developer-facing" representation of the error value.
