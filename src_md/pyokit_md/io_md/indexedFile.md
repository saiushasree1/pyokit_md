The `indexedFile.py` script provides classes and functions for efficiently indexing large files composed of many independent records. The primary goal is to enable fast random access to specific records without loading the entire file into memory.

**Core Functionality:**

The module introduces the `IndexedFile` class, which manages an in-memory index mapping unique record identifiers (hashes) to their byte offsets within the physical file. This allows direct seeking to a record's location once its hash is known.

Key features include:
- **On-demand Indexing:** The file is indexed progressively as records are requested. If a requested record's hash isn't in the index, the file is scanned until it's found or the end of the file is reached.
- **Customizable Record Handling:** Users provide a `record_iterator` function to parse records from the file and a `record_hash_function` to generate unique keys for each record.
- **Index Persistence:** The index can be written to and read from a separate file, enabling the reuse of pre-built indices.
- **Error Handling:** A custom `IndexError` class is defined to manage exceptions related to index operations.

**Structure:**

1.  **Header Comments:** Detailed information including creation date, description, copyright, author, and licensing (GNU General Public License v3 or later).
2.  **Imports:** Standard Python modules (`StringIO`, `unittest`, `os`, `sys`) and a utility import from `pyokit.util.progressIndicator`.
3.  **`IndexError` Class:**
    *   A custom exception class for errors encountered during indexed file manipulation.
    *   `__init__`: Initializes with a message.
    *   `__str__`: Returns a string representation of the exception message.
4.  **`IndexedFile` Class:**
    *   **`__init__`**:
        *   Initializes with optional `indexed_file` (filename or stream), `record_iterator`, and `record_hash_function`.
        *   Sets up internal attributes: `_index` (the core hash-to-offset dictionary), `_indexed_filename`, `_indexed_file_handle`, and `_no_reindex` (a flag to prevent re-indexing).
        *   Handles `indexed_file` input, attempting to treat it as a filename or a file-like object.
    *   **`indexed_file` Property (Getter and Setter):**
        *   **Getter (`@property`):** Returns a tuple `(filename, handle)` for the indexed file.
        *   **Setter (`@indexed_file.setter`):**
            *   Manages setting the indexed file, opening a handle if only a filename is provided.
            *   Clears the existing index if the new file doesn't match the previously indexed one or if no file is provided.
            *   Requires `record_iterator` and `record_hash_function` to be set if a file is being assigned.
    *   **`__build_index` (Private Method):**
        *   Expands the in-memory index by reading records from the `_indexed_file_handle`.
        *   Can index until a specific hash value is found (`until` parameter) or the entire file is processed.
        *   `flush` parameter allows discarding existing index data.
        *   Includes verbose progress indication if enabled.
    *   **`__len__`**: Returns the number of entries in the current index.
    *   **`__getitem__`**:
        *   Allows accessing records using their hash value (e.g., `indexed_file[hash_value]`).
        *   If the `hash_value` is not in the index, it triggers `__build_index` to attempt to find it.
        *   Raises `IndexError` if the record is not found or if `_no_reindex` is set.
        *   Seeks to the record's location, reads the record using the `record_iterator`, and returns it. Restores the file handle's original position.
    *   **`__eq__`**: Compares two `IndexedFile` objects based on the equality of their internal `_index` dictionaries.
    *   **`__str__`**: Returns a string representation of the index (hash-to-offset pairs). *Caution: Can be very large.*
    *   **`write_index`**:
        *   Writes the current index to a specified file or stream.
        *   Optionally `generate`s the full index before writing.
        *   The output format is tab-separated: `key(s)\tfile_location`.
    *   **`__iter__`**: Returns an iterator over the index keys.
    *   **`read_index`**:
        *   Populates the index from a given file or stream.
        *   Parses lines expecting tab-separated `key(s)\tfile_location`.
        *   Allows setting the `record_iterator`, `record_hash_function`, and a `parse_hash` function for key conversion.
        *   `flush` parameter controls whether to clear the existing index before loading.
        *   `no_reindex` parameter controls whether missing keys should trigger a re-scan or raise an error after loading.
        *   Includes verbose progress indication.
5.  **`TestIndexedFile` Class (Unit Tests):**
    *   Uses `unittest.TestCase` to verify the functionality of `IndexedFile`.
    *   **`setUp`**: Defines a `dummy_iterator` and `dummy_hash` function for a simple test file format (ID followed by space-separated parts). Also defines `self.test_case_0` as a string representing a sample indexed file.
    *   **Test Methods (`test_indexedFile_raw`, `test_indexedFile_already_indexed`, `test_indexedFile_not_present`, `test_indexedFile_allFullIndex`, `test_indexedFile_write_read_equality`):** Cover various scenarios like initial indexing, accessing already indexed items, requesting non-existent items, forcing a full index, and round-tripping an index through file write/read.
6.  **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == '__main__':`)**: Runs the unit tests if the script is executed directly.

**Important Details:**

*   **File Handling:** The class is flexible, accepting both filenames and file-like objects (streams) for the indexed file and for reading/writing the index.
*   **Lazy Indexing:** The `__build_index` method is only called when a record is requested that hasn't been indexed yet. This is a crucial optimization for very large files.
*   **Index Structure:** The `_index` is a dictionary where keys are the `record_hash_function`'s output and values are the byte offsets in the indexed file.
*   **Performance:** The primary benefit of this class is for random access to records in large files where full in-memory storage is not feasible. Sequential access might not see a significant speedup after the initial index build.
*   **Extensibility:** The `record_iterator` and `record_hash_function` parameters make the `IndexedFile` class highly adaptable to different file formats and record structures.
*   **Progress Indicator:** The use of `ProgressIndicator` from `pyokit.util` is a nice touch for user feedback during potentially long indexing or loading operations.
