The file `ioError.py` defines a custom exception class, `PyokitIOError`, specifically for handling input/output (IO) related errors within the `pyokit` framework.

**Key Functionality:**

*   **Custom Exception:** `PyokitIOError` inherits from `pyokit.common.pyokitError.PyokitError`, establishing a hierarchical exception structure. This means `PyokitIOError` is a specialized type of `PyokitError`.
*   **Placeholder Class:** Currently, `PyokitIOError` is a simple placeholder (`pass`) without any additional methods or attributes beyond what it inherits. Its primary purpose is to provide a distinct type for IO-related exceptions, allowing for more granular error handling and identification within the `pyokit` ecosystem.

**Structure:**

*   The file starts with a shebang line `#!/usr/bin/python`.
*   It includes a comprehensive docstring detailing creation date, description, copyright, authors, and licensing information (GNU General Public License v3 or later).
*   It imports `PyokitError` from `pyokit.common.pyokitError`.
*   The core of the file is the definition of the `PyokitIOError` class.

**Important Details:**

*   This module is part of the `pyokit` library and is intended to standardize IO error handling.
*   While currently basic, this class serves as an extensible foundation. Future enhancements might involve adding specific error codes, messages, or context information directly to `PyokitIOError` or its subclasses for more detailed error reporting.
*   The licensing (GPLv3) indicates that this software is free and open-source.
