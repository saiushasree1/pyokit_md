The Python script `convertJunctionReads.py` is designed to transform "junction reads" from a BED-like input format into "exon reads." Junction reads span across splice junctions, while exon reads represent segments within a single exon. The script offers various strategies for this conversion, determining how a junction read is assigned to one or both of its constituent exons.

**Core Functionality:**

The primary purpose of the script is to process input representing "junction reads" and output "exon reads." A junction read, as implied by the code, appears to have its `chrom` field formatted to include coordinates of two exons (e.g., `chrom_exon1start_exon1end_exon2start_exon2end`). The script then uses these coordinates and the read's original start/end to derive new `GenomicInterval` objects representing the corresponding exon reads.

**Conversion Schemes:**

The script supports several conversion schemes, controllable via command-line options:

*   **`FIRST_EXON`**: Assigns the junction read entirely to the first exon it spans.
*   **`SECOND_EXON`**: Assigns the junction read entirely to the second exon it spans.
*   **`BOTH_EXONS`**: Splits the junction read into two separate exon reads, one for each exon it spans. This is the default behavior.
*   **`BIGGEST_EXON`**: Assigns the junction read to the exon (either first or second) that contributes a larger portion to the read.
*   **`FIVE_PRIME_END`**: Assigns the read to the 5' end exon based on strand.

**Structure and Key Components:**

1.  **Header and Licensing:** Standard Python shebang, copyright information, and GNU General Public License (GPLv3) details.
2.  **Imports:** Utilizes standard Python libraries like `sys`, `random`, `unittest`, `collections`, `StringIO`, and custom modules from `pyokit` for command-line interface (`CLI`), BED file iteration (`BEDIterator`), genomic interval manipulation (`GenomicInterval`, `parseBEDString`), and testing utilities (`DummyInputStream`, `DummyOutputStream`).
3.  **Constants:** Defines strings for the various conversion schemes and default settings (`DEFAULT_SCHEME`, `DEFAULT_VERBOSITY`).
4.  **User Interface (`getUI`)**:
    *   Uses `pyokit.interface.cli.CLI` to define and parse command-line arguments.
    *   Options include:
        *   `-o` / `--output`: Output filename (defaults to stdout).
        *   `-v` / `--verbose`: Enables verbose output to stderr.
        *   `-s` / `--scheme`: Specifies the conversion scheme (e.g., `FIRST_EXON`, `BOTH_EXONS`).
        *   `-h` / `--help`: Displays help message.
        *   `-u` / `--test`: Runs unit tests.
    *   Accepts an optional input filename as a positional argument (defaults to stdin).
5.  **Command Line Processing (`_main`)**:
    *   Parses command-line arguments using `getUI`.
    *   Handles `--test` to run `unittest.main()` and `--help` to display usage.
    *   Determines input and output file handles (stdin/stdout or specified files).
    *   Retrieves the chosen conversion `scheme`.
    *   Calls `processBED` to perform the core logic.
6.  **Main Program Logic (`processBED`)**:
    *   Iterates through input BED reads using `BEDIterator`.
    *   Parses the `chrom` field of each read to extract the start and end coordinates of the two exons (`chrom1SeqStart`, `chrom1SeqEnd`, `chrom2SeqStart`). This implies a specific non-standard BED `chrom` format for junction reads.
    *   Creates `GenomicInterval` objects for the `firstExon` and `secondExon` based on the chosen `scheme`.
    *   Modifies the `name` of the new exon reads by appending `"%1"` or `"%2"` to distinguish them.
    *   Applies the logic of the selected `scheme` to decide which exon(s) to output.
    *   Includes a sanity check to ensure the generated `GenomicInterval` has a non-empty chromosome.
    *   Writes the resulting exon read(s) to the output handle.
7.  **Unit Tests (`ConvertJunctionsUnitTests`)**:
    *   Comprehensive unit tests covering various aspects of the conversion process.
    *   `setUp`: Generates a large number of random "junction reads" for testing.
    *   `randomString`, `randomName`, `randomBEDElement`, `randomJunctionRead`: Helper functions for generating random test data.
    *   `testInclusion`: Verifies that reads from input appear in output (and vice-versa), considering `BOTH_EXONS` doubles the output count.
    *   `testBothExonsScheme`: Checks the correctness of exon sizes and relative indices when `BOTH_EXONS` scheme is used.
    *   `testFirstExonScheme`: Checks correctness for the `FIRST_EXON` scheme.
    *   `testSecondExonScheme`: Checks correctness for the `SECOND_EXON` scheme.
8.  **Main Entry Point (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**:
    *   Calls `_main` with command-line arguments.
    *   Includes a basic exception handler to catch unexpected errors.

**Important Details and Potential Considerations:**

*   **Custom BED `chrom` Format:** The script relies heavily on a specific, non-standard format for the `chrom` field of input "junction reads" (e.g., `chrX_exon1start_exon1end_exon2start_exon2end`). This is a crucial dependency for the script to function correctly. Without this format, the parsing of `chrom.split("_")` will fail or produce incorrect results.
*   **`pyokit` Dependency:** The script uses custom `pyokit` libraries. These would need to be installed or accessible for the script to run.
*   **Read Name Modification:** Appending `"%1"` or `"%2"` to read names is a fixed behavior. Users should be aware that the original read names will be altered in the output.
*   **Arbitrary Decision for `BIGGEST_EXON` Tie:** If `BIGGEST_EXON` is chosen and both exons have the same length, the script arbitrarily prioritizes the `firstExon`.
*   **`FIVE_PRIME_END` Scheme:** This scheme seems partially implemented or has specific conditions for its logic (only checks strand for `+` or `-`). The length comparison for `BIGGEST_EXON` seems more robust for general cases.
*   **Error Handling:** The `_main` function has a general `try-except` block, but more specific error handling for malformed input or file issues could be beneficial.
*   **Efficiency:** For very large BED files, the `StringIO` usage in tests might be a bottleneck, but the `BEDIterator` in `processBED` is designed for efficient iteration.

In summary, `convertJunctionReads.py` is a specialized tool for converting genomic junction reads into exon-specific reads, offering flexible assignment strategies. Its reliance on a specific input `chrom` format and the `pyokit` library are key aspects to note.
