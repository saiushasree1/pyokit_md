The Python script `genomicIntJaccard.py` is designed to calculate the Jaccard index between two sets of genomic intervals provided in BED files.

**Core Functionality:**
The script's primary purpose is to compute the Jaccard index, a statistic used to gauge the similarity between two sample sets, in the context of genomic regions. It takes two BED files as input, each containing genomic interval data, and outputs their Jaccard index.

**Structure:**

1.  **Header and Copyright:** Standard GNU General Public License (GPLv3) information and author details.
2.  **Imports:**
    *   Standard Python modules (`os`, `sys`, `unittest`, `StringIO`).
    *   `mock` for unit testing.
    *   `pyokit` library components:
        *   `CLI`, `Option` for command-line interface parsing.
        *   `BEDIterator` for reading BED file data.
        *   `jaccardIndex` for the core Jaccard index calculation logic.
        *   `build_mock_open_side_effect` for unit testing file I/O.
3.  **`getUI(args)` Function:**
    *   Constructs and returns a `CLI` object, defining the command-line interface for the script.
    *   Sets program name, descriptions, and required argument count (2 input files).
    *   Adds options for verbosity (`-v/--verbose`), strandedness (`-s/--stranded`), help (`-h/--help`), and running unit tests (`-u/--test`).
    *   Parses the provided command-line arguments.
4.  **`main(args)` Function:**
    *   The main entry point for the script's execution.
    *   Obtains the parsed command-line options and arguments using `getUI`.
    *   **Conditional Execution:**
        *   If the "test" option is set, it executes the `unittest.main()` function to run the defined unit tests.
        *   If the "help" option is set, it displays the script's usage information.
        *   Otherwise (normal execution):
            *   Checks for "verbose" and "stranded" options.
            *   **Important Note:** The "stranded" mode is explicitly mentioned as "not yet implemented" and causes the script to exit if enabled.
            *   Reads the genomic regions from the two input BED files (obtained from `ui.getArgument(0)` and `ui.getArgument(1)`) using `BEDIterator`.
            *   Calculates the Jaccard index of the two sets of regions using `jaccardIndex` from the `pyokit.datastruct.genomicInterval` module.
            *   Prints the calculated Jaccard index to standard output.
5.  **`TestGenomicIntJaccard` Class (Unit Tests):**
    *   A `unittest.TestCase` subclass for testing the script's functionality.
    *   **`setUp` method:**
        *   Defines mock content for two BED files (`file1.bed`, `file2.bed`).
        *   Uses `build_mock_open_side_effect` to create a side effect for `mock.patch('__builtin__.open')`, allowing the tests to simulate reading these file contents without actual disk I/O.
    *   **`test_simple` method:**
        *   Uses `@mock.patch` to mock `__builtin__.open` and `sys.stdout`.
        *   Sets the `side_effect` for the mocked `open` to the pre-defined mock file contents.
        *   Calls `main` with the mock file names.
        *   Asserts that the output printed to `sys.stdout` (captured by `mock_stdout`) is approximately equal to the expected Jaccard index value.
6.  **Entry Point (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**
    *   If the script is executed directly, it runs `unittest.main(argv=[sys.argv[0]])`. This means that by default, running the script directly will execute its unit tests. To run the main functionality, command-line arguments *must* be provided (e.g., `python genomicIntJaccard.py file1.bed file2.bed`).

**Important Details and Caveats:**

*   **`pyokit` Dependency:** This script heavily relies on the `pyokit` library for its core functionalities like CLI parsing, BED file iteration, and Jaccard index calculation. `pyokit` is not a standard library and would need to be installed or available in the Python path for this script to run.
*   **Jaccard Index Calculation:** The actual Jaccard index computation (`jaccardIndex`) is delegated to the `pyokit` library, implying that the script doesn't implement this algorithm itself.
*   **Stranded Mode Not Implemented:** A significant limitation is that the "stranded" option (`-s/--stranded`) is explicitly stated as unimplemented, and attempting to use it will cause the script to exit.
*   **Unit Test Focus:** The default behavior when run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) is to execute unit tests. Users need to provide arguments to run the Jaccard index calculation on actual files.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Uses a custom `CLI` class from `pyokit` for argument parsing, providing options for verbosity, help, and testing.
