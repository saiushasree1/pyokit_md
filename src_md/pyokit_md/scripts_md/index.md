The `index.py` script is a Python utility designed to **build and utilize indexes for large biological sequence alignment files**, specifically focusing on RepeatMasker alignment files and MAF (Multiple Alignment Format) genome alignment files. This allows for efficient lookup and extraction of specific data blocks from these files.

**Core Functionality:**

The script provides two main operational modes:

1.  **`build`**: Creates an index file (`.idx`) for a given alignment file. This index stores metadata (like offsets and keys) to quickly locate specific records within the original data file without having to parse the entire file.
2.  **`lookup`**: Uses a previously built index file to efficiently retrieve specific alignment blocks from the original indexed data file. It supports both command-line key lookup and interactive key entry.

**Structure and Key Components:**

*   **Constants and Enums:**
    *   `DEFAULT_VERBOSITY`: A boolean flag for default verbose output.
    *   `FileType(Enum)`: Defines supported file types (`genome_alignment`, `reapeat_masker_alignment_file`).

*   **Indexers:**
    *   `index_repeatmasker_alignment_by_id`: Indexes RepeatMasker alignment files by a unique ID.
    *   `index_genome_alignment_by_locus`: Indexes MAF genome alignment files using genomic coordinates (chromosome, start, end) as keys, specifically using "hg19" as the reference species. It leverages `pyokit.io.indexedFile.IndexedFile` for the indexing logic.
    *   `get_indexer_by_filetype`: Returns the appropriate indexer function based on the `FileType` enum.
    *   `get_indexer_by_file_extension`: Attempts to determine the correct indexer based on file extensions (currently only `.maf` or `maf` for genome alignments).

*   **Index Lookups:**
    *   `lookup_genome_alignment_index`: Loads a genome alignment index and its corresponding data file, then extracts one or more blocks based on provided keys. It supports interactive key input if no key is specified on the command line.
    *   `get_lookup_by_filetype`: Returns the appropriate lookup function based on the `FileType` enum.
    *   `get_lookup_by_file_extension`: Attempts to determine the correct lookup function based on file extensions.

*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   `getUI_build_index`: Configures and returns a `CLI` (Command Line Interface) object for the `build` command, defining its options (`-o` output, `-t` type, `-v` verbose, `-h` help, `-u` test).
    *   `getUI_lookup_index`: Configures and returns a `CLI` object for the `lookup` command, defining its options (`-o` output, `-k` key, `-t` type, `-v` verbose, `-h` help, `-u` test).
    *   The UI is built using the `pyokit.interface.cli.CLI` module.

*   **Command Line Processing and Dispatch:**
    *   `__get_indexer` and `__get_lookup`: Internal helper functions to determine which indexer/lookup function to use, either explicitly via the `--type` option or by attempting to infer it from file extensions.
    *   `main`: The primary entry point that parses the initial command-line argument (`build` or `lookup`) and dispatches to the relevant main function (`main_build_index` or `main_lookup_index`). It also displays a general help message if no arguments or help is requested.
    *   `main_lookup_index`: Handles the `lookup` command's logic, parsing options, opening files, and calling the appropriate lookup function.
    *   `main_build_index`: Handles the `build` command's logic, parsing options, handling input/output files (including stdin/stdout), and calling the appropriate indexer.

*   **Unit Tests (`TestIndex` class):**
    *   Includes `unittest` cases to verify the indexing and lookup functionality, particularly for genome alignments (`.maf` files).
    *   Uses `mock` to simulate file operations (`__builtin__.open`) during tests, preventing actual file system interactions and ensuring reproducibility.

**Dependencies:**

The script relies heavily on the `pyokit` library, specifically:
*   `pyokit.interface.cli` for command-line parsing.
*   `pyokit.interface.uiError` for UI-related exceptions.
*   `pyokit.io.indexedFile` for the core indexing logic.
*   `pyokit.datastruct.multipleAlignment` and `pyokit.io.repeatmaskerAlignments` for RepeatMasker specific parsing.
*   `pyokit.io.genomeAlignment` and `pyokit.datastruct.genomeAlignment` for MAF genome alignment specific parsing and data structures.

It also uses standard Python modules like `sys`, `os`, `unittest`, `StringIO`, `functools`, and the `enum` module (for Python 2 compatibility).

**Important Details & Caveats:**

*   **Python 2 Compatibility:** The code explicitly imports `StringIO` and `__builtin__` for mocking, and uses `raw_input`, suggesting it's designed to run on Python 2.
*   **File Type Guessing:** The script attempts to guess the file type based on extensions (`.maf` for genome alignments). If multiple extensions are present or stdin is used without the `-t` option, it will raise an error, requiring the user to explicitly specify the file type.
*   **Genome Alignment Specifics:** For genome alignments, it hardcodes "hg19" as the `reference_species` in `genome_alignment_iterator`.
*   **Error Handling:** It uses `PyokitUIError` and `IndexError` for command-line and indexing-related errors, respectively. `ValueError` is raised for unsupported file types.
*   **Licensing:** The script is released under the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 or any later version.
