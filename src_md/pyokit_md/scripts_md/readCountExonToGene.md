The Python script `readCountExonToGene.py` is designed to calculate gene-level read counts from exon-level read counts and a BED file containing gene locations. It takes two primary input files: a tab-separated file with exon names and their corresponding read counts, and a BED file detailing gene locations. The output is a modified BED file where the score field for each gene is updated with the sum of read counts from all exons that fall within that gene's genomic boundaries.

**Key Components and Functionality:**

1.  **`Exon` Class:**
    *   Represents an individual exon, parsing its details (RefSeq ID, exon number, chromosome, location, strand) and read count from a string.
    *   Includes a `__str__` method for easy string representation and a `isIn` method to check if an exon's location falls within a given BED element (gene).
    *   Performs a basic sanity check during initialization to ensure internal parsing matches the original input.

2.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    *   Uses the `pyokit.interface.cli.CLI` module to handle command-line arguments.
    *   Options include:
        *   `-o` / `--output`: Specifies an output file (defaults to stdout).
        *   `-v` / `--verbose`: Enables verbose output to stderr.
        *   `-r` / `--reference`: **Required** path to the BED file containing gene/transcript locations.
        *   `-h` / `--help`: Displays help message.
        *   `-u` / `--test`: Runs the integrated unit tests.
    *   The first positional argument, if provided, is treated as the input file for exon counts; otherwise, it reads from stdin.

3.  **`readCountExonToGeneError` Exception:**
    *   A custom exception class for errors specific to this script.

4.  **`readExonCounts(fh)` Function:**
    *   Reads the input file (either a file path or a file handle) containing exon read counts.
    *   It attempts to parse lines assuming either a simple two-column format (`exon_name \t count`) or a BED-like format where the 4th column is `details` and the 5th is `count`.
    *   Creates and returns a list of `Exon` objects.

5.  **`makeExonDictionary(exons)` Function:**
    *   Takes a list of `Exon` objects.
    *   Organizes these exons into a nested dictionary for efficient lookup: `byChrom[chromosome][strand][refseq_id] = [list_of_exons]`. This structure allows quick retrieval of relevant exons for a given gene.

6.  **`process(infh, reffh, outfh, verbose=False, debug=False)` Function (Core Logic):**
    *   Reads exon counts from `infh` and builds the `exonHash` dictionary.
    *   Iterates through each gene/transcript in the reference BED file (`reffh`) using `pyokit.io.bedIterators.BEDIterator`.
    *   For each gene, it attempts to find matching exons in the `exonHash` based on chromosome, strand, and RefSeq ID.
    *   It then iterates through these potential "hits" and, for each exon that is confirmed to be spatially `isIn` the current gene, its read count is added to a running total for that gene.
    *   The final aggregated count is assigned to the `score` attribute of the `BEDElement` object representing the gene.
    *   The updated `BEDElement` string (representing the gene with its new total read count) is written to `outfh`.

7.  **Unit Tests (`ExonToGeneReadCountTests`):**
    *   Includes a `unittest.TestCase` class to ensure the core logic functions correctly.
    *   `setUp` defines sample gene BED data and exon count data.
    *   `testSimpleKeys` runs the `process` function with dummy input streams and verifies the output against expected results.

**Execution Flow:**

*   When run as a standalone script (`if __name__ == "__main__":`), `_main` is called.
*   `_main` parses command-line arguments using `getUI`.
*   If `test` is specified, unit tests are executed.
*   If `help` is specified, usage information is displayed.
*   Otherwise, it opens input and output files/streams based on the CLI arguments and then calls the `process` function to perform the main calculation.
*   Includes basic error handling for unexpected exceptions.

**Important Details:**

*   **Licensing:** The script is released under the GNU General Public License v3 or later.
*   **Dependencies:** Relies on `pyokit` library for CLI, testing, and BED file iteration.
*   **Exon Naming Convention:** The `Exon` class specifically parses exon names following a pattern like `NM_000014_exon_16_0_chr12_9134219_r` to extract RefSeq ID, exon number, chromosome, location, and strand. Deviations from this pattern for input exon names might cause issues.
*   **File Formats:** The exon count input file is expected to be either a two-column tab-separated file or a BED-like file. The gene reference file *must* be a BED file.
*   **Efficiency:** The `makeExonDictionary` function is a crucial optimization, creating a hash-like structure to quickly look up exons by chromosome, strand, and RefSeq ID, rather than iterating through all exons for every gene.
